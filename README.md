# Sales-Insights---Data-Analysis
A Sales Insights Dashboard for bricks-and-motor businesses from 2017 to 2020 utilizing a SQL dataset via PostgreSQL! üìäüè¢ Unlocking actionable data from sales metrics to foot traffic trends, this dashboard empowers strategic decision-making. Dive into trends, optimize operations, and drive growth! 
The dashboard consists of different 3 Analyses:
## I. Key Insights - Sales Analysis
## II. Key Insights - Profit Analysis
## III. Performance Analysis Insights

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- Acquire the Sales Insights dataset for the years 2017 to 2020.
- Clean and prepare the data for analysis. This involves handling missing data, data transformation, and potentially creating new calculated columns through Power Query Editor.
### 2. Data Model:
- In Power BI, create a data model that includes the tables, relationships, and measures necessary for your analysis. Common tables could include Customers, Products, Markets, Dates, and Transactions.
### 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Define the KPIs you want to measure on your dashboard, such as total sales, profit margin, quantity, average sales and profit, profit Margin %, etc.
### 4. Time Intelligence:
- Implement time intelligence functions to enable easy filtering by year, quarter, month, and day. This will allow users to analyze data over time.
### 5. Visualizations:
Create visualizations like charts, tables, and graphs to represent your data effectively. Some common visualizations to consider include:
- Line charts to show profit, and revenue trends over the years.
- Bar charts to compare sales, profit by customer, and products.
- KPI cards to display key metrics.
- Tables to show detailed data and trends.
-Pie charts to compare sales, and profit by zone, product, and customer type.
### 6. Slicers and Filters:
- Add slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the data. For example, users should be able to select specific years, zones, products, and customer types to focus on.
### 7. Custom Calculations:
- Utilize DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom calculations and measures to derive insights beyond what the raw data offers.
- Calculations and measures like : Profit margin %, Profit Contribution %, Revenue Contribution % and so on.
### 8. Dashboard Navigation:
- Organize your visualizations into different pages or sections to make navigation intuitive. Users should be able to find what they need easily.
